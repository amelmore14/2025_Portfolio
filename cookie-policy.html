    <p>
      This Cookie Policy explains how Allison Elmore ("I", "me", or "my") uses
      cookies and similar technologies on

    <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small text files placed on your device to help websites
      operate efficiently and provide information to site owners. They can be
      used for a variety of purposes, including site functionality, analytics,
      and personalized content.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Use Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      I use cookies solely for website analytics through
      <strong>Google Analytics</strong>. This helps me understand how visitors
      interact with my Website &mdash; such as which pages are most popular, how
      users navigate through the site, and other general usage patterns. This
      information allows me to improve the Website's performance and user
      experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Google Analytics cookies collect information in an anonymous form and do
      not identify individual visitors.
    </p>

    <h2>Managing Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Most web browsers allow you to control and block cookies through your
      browser settings. You can also opt out of Google Analytics tracking by
      using the
      <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"
        >Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that disabling cookies may affect how this Website functions
      for you.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      I may update this Cookie Policy occasionally to reflect changes in
      technology, legal requirements, or my Website practices. When I update it,
      I will revise the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
